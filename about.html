    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mahima — a passionate and detail-oriented web developer with a strong focus on creating responsive, accessible, and high-performance websites.</p>

    <p>My journey into web development began with a fascination for how design and logic come together to build experiences that people interact with daily.
    Over time, I’ve built a solid foundation in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, with a growing interest in front-end frameworks and full-stack development.</p>

    <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT) at Padma Kanya Multiple Campus, affiliated with Tribhuvan University.
    My academic journey, paired with personal projects, has helped me gain hands-on experience in building clean, interactive, and user-friendly web applications.</p>

    <p>I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to continuously grow as a developer.
    I believe in writing clean, maintainable code, focusing on usability and performance, and keeping up with evolving web standards and best practices.</p>

    <p><i>My goals include:</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer capable of building complete web solutions from the ground up</li>
        <li>Collaborating on impactful projects that solve real-world problems</li>
        <li>Contributing to open-source communities and learning from other developers</li>
        <li>Gaining professional experience through internships or junior developer roles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Eventually mentoring others and leading development teams with empathy and technical confidence.</p>

    <p>I’m excited about the future, open to new challenges, and eager to contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact.
    All I need is the right opportunity to grow, build, and thrive — one line of code at a time.</p>
